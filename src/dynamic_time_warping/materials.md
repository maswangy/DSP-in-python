Appicaltion:
Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences. Also, it
can generate "optimal match". According to this match, we can produce a warping path for warping signals to make
them aligned in time.

Question:
1. how to speed up?
2. how to measure the its distance? no satiesfie the triangular inequality?
3. just write the basic version
